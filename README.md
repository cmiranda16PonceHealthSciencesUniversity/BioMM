## BioMM
BioMM: Biological-informed Multi-stage Machine learning framework for phenotype prediction using omics data

## Features of BioMM in a nutshell

1. Applicability for various omics data modalities (e.g. methylome, transcriptomics, genomics).   
2. Various biological stratification strategies.    
3. Prioritizing outcome-associated functional patterns.   
4. End-to-end prediction at the individual level based on biological stratified patterns.   
4. Possibility for an extension to machine learning models of interest.   
6. Parallel computing. 

## Installation 

BioMM has been incorporated into the [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc//html/BioMM.html).
To install this package, start R (version "4.0") and enter:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("BioMM", version = "4.0")
``` 

## Tutorial
