\title{Return the data by feature filtering}
\usage{
getDataByFilter(trainData, testData, FSmethod, cutP = 0.1, fdr = NULL,
  FScore = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{trainData}{The input training dataset. The first column is the label.}

\item{testData}{The input test dataset. The first column is the label.}

\item{FSmethod}{Feature selection methods. Available options are 
c(NULL, 'positive', 'wilcox.test', 'cor.test', 'chisq.test', 'posWilcox', 
or 'top10pCor'). 'positive' is the positively outcome-associated features
using the Pearson correlation method. 'posWilcox' is the positively 
outcome-associated features using Pearson correlation method together 
with 'wilcox.text' method. 'top10pCor' is the top 10% of   
outcome-associcated features. This is helpful when no features can be 
picked during stringent feature selection procedure.}

\item{cutP}{The cutoff used for p value thresholding. It can be any value 
between 0 and 1. Commonly used cutoffs are c(0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, etc.). 
The default is 0.1.}

\item{fdr}{Multiple testing correction method. Available options are 
c(NULL, 'fdr', 'BH', 'holm' etc). 
See also \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}}. The default is NULL.}

\item{FScore}{The number of cores used for some feature selection methods.
The default is 10.}
}
\value{
Both training and test data (if provided) with pre-selected 
features are returned if feature selection method is applied. 
If no feature can be selected during feature selection procedure, then the 
output is NULL.
}
\description{
Identify and select a subset of outcome-associated or predictive features in 
the training data based on filtering methods. Return the same set of selected 
features for the test data if it is available.
}
\details{
Parallel computing is helpful if your input data is high  
dimensional. For 'cutP', a soft thresholding of 0.1 may be favorable than 
more stringent p value cutoff because the features with small effect size 
can be taken into consideration for downstream analysis. However, for high 
dimensional (e.g. p > 10,000) data, many false positive features may 
exist, thus, rigorous p value thresholding should be applied.  
The choice of feature selection method depends on the characteristics of 
the input data.

\examples{
## Load data  
methylfile <- system.file('extdata', 'methylData.rds', package='BioMM')  
methylData <- readRDS(methylfile)  
trainIndex <- sample(nrow(methylData), 20)
trainData = methylData[trainIndex,]
testData = methylData[-trainIndex,]
## Feature selection  
## Select outcome-associated features based on the Wilcoxon test (P<0.1)
datalist <- getDataByFilter(trainData, testData, FSmethod="wilcox.test", 
                           cutP=0.1, fdr=NULL, FScore=10)
trainDataSub <- datalist[[1]] 
testDataSub <- datalist[[2]] 
print(dim(trainData))
print(dim(trainDataSub))
